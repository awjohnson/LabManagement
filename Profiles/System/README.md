These profiles are for system and user enviroment settings. Some where crearted by exporting the old MCX settings from the Open Direcrtory server using MCX Tim Sutton's mcxToProfile (https://github.com/timsutton/mcxToProfile). Some were created using an Apple's Profile Manager on macOS Server. Others where created from local client preference (plist) files using mcxToProfile, and others were downloaded from various other members of the Macintosh admin community, and unfortunately, at this point I don't remember which profiles came from which author.
